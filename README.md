# Cellular Memories
I've put in the basic code. MHN_backup is the code Dima gave me where he tested it out on MNIST (data also included here). The other notebooks are all my experimentation with RNAseq (I havent put the data for any of it on here), and to be honest the latest versions of them might have some scaling issues with them since I remember I was doing some experimentation. There's also an R file for RNAseq processing that I'll find and add here soon. But initially, you should try running Dima's tensorflow code on MNIST to see if you can get the hang of it, so the RNAseq part is not relevant anyways.
